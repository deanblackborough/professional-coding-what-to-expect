I was inspired to create this site after reading a thread on the ArsTechnica forum; it is a collection of answers provided freely by professional developers, I have merely collated and organised the responses.

Ivan asked the question below;

I've graduated recently and just got a job in a big software company (red one, hates API's ;) ). Now I was wondering what should I expect upon starting my life in this strange, new, corporate world. Any tips anybody wishes somebody told them when they were starting?

I've grouped some of the responses below, to read the entire thread unedited, please visit the ArsTechnica forums. If you have any suggestions, just fork the site and submit a pull request.

The first year

Coding for 8 hours a day takes some getting used to. Jehos (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33476213#p33476213)
You will learn more about the practical side of software development during your first month on the job than you did in your entire degree program. jbode (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33476507#p33476507)
As a freshout you are going to get a bunch of boring maintenance tasks (at least that's what you should be getting). This is a normal apprenticeship period, and it's to get you familiar with the code base and any processes and procedures. You're not going to spend all day every day coding - you'll be going to meetings, doing some training, reading (or, if you're me, ignoring) lots and lots and lots and lots of emails, troubleshooting, and coordinating with other teams (QA, product development, operations, etc.).  jbode (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33477323#p33477323)

Your skill

After a year or two, you will think you know everything. You are wrong. Jehos (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33476213#p33476213)
You probably have some idea of where you stand in the world. How your aptitude stacks up against everyone else. Throw those ideas away. Until now, you've been in ponds that are populated by beginners. (Beginners with a lot of aptitude are still beginners.) You'll be working with people who have forgotten more than you've ever learned. Dunning Kruger is a thing, especially in people who don't really understand just how big the global pond is. hanser (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33515489#p33515489)

Best practice

Unit testing is hard but worth it. Apteris (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33476307#p33476307)


Working with others

Learn to communicate, both verbally and in writing. The better you are at this, the better your job prospects are. Jehos (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33476851#p33476851)
If you don't know something, ask. I don't know how many times I've come across people that don't ask questions out of a fear of being called stupid or some other nonsense. Bastard (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33517377#p33517377)


General rules

There are fads in programming. Learn the new stuff, but don't think it's the One True Way. It's not. Jehos (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33476213#p33476213)
Learn how to ask good questions. Learn how to not know things. Yes, that really is a skill. Learn to self-learn, if you don't already. Learn to JIT your learning. hanser (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33515489#p33515489)



Life, career goals

Your five-year plan needs to include determining if you have the capability to manage people and if you are interested in managing people. If you can manage and want to manage, work toward management. If you can't or won't, you need to specialize in something. Go deep in a technology or business vertical, learn to architect, whatever. You just need to know if your career will aim toward management or if you will stay technical. You should be able to figure that out in about 5 years. If you are very good at communication and putting the user first, seriously consider the management path. Jehos (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33476851#p33476851)
Start a project journal. 

In this journal track every project you work on. Some of the information you will know from the start of the project, some will be acquired during the project and some you will pick up later.

Here is a list of information to include to get you started. As the years go by you will probably make adjustments to this list.

Project name
Start and end dates
Company
Client
Principal project members and the project members you were in direct contact with. Make a note of contact information for each.
Technology
Your role in the project
Make a note of anything that was interesting or different about this project. Technology, infrastructure, process, etc. Follow up with a description if this difference helped or hurt the project.
For everything that went wrong in the project make a note what went wrong, why it went wrong and how it was fixed.
After the project is complete make a list of the lessons you learned on this project.
Anytime you hear updated information about the project make a note. For example, 5 years later you could learn that the client is still using the project â€“ make a note of that. If you learn they increased revenue by 50% without adding any staff then make a note of that. Max Quad (https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=33534021#p33534021)
