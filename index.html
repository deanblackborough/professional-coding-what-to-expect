                                (red one, hates API's ;) ). I was wondering, what should I expect upon starting my
                                life in this strange, new, corporate world. Any tips anybody wishes somebody told
                                them when they were starting?</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Your five-year plan needs to include determining if you have the
                                capability to manage people and if you are interested in managing people. If
                                you can manage, and want to manage, work toward management. If you can't or
                                won't, you need to specialise in something. Go deep into a technology or
                                business vertical, learn to architect, whatever. You just need to know if your
                                career will aim toward management or if you will stay technical. </p>

                            <p class="card-text">You should be able to figure out your long term goals within five
                                years. If you are skilled at communication and putting the user first,
                                consider the management path.</p>

                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p class="card-text">In this journal track every project. Some of the information you will know from
                                the beginning of the project, some you will acquire during the project, some
                                you will pick up later.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Here is a list of information to include to help you get started. As the years
                                go by you will probably make adjustments to this list.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Project name</li>
                                <li>Start and end dates</li>
                                <li>Company</li>
                                <li>Client</li>
                                <li>Principal project members and the project members you were in direct contact with. Make a
                                    note of contact information for each.</li>
                                <li>Technology</li>
                                <li>Your role in the project</li>
                                <li>Make a note of anything that was interesting or different about the project. That could be
                                    the technology, infrastructure, process, etc. Follow up with a description and detail
                                    whether the difference helped or hurt the project.</li>
                                <li>For everything that went wrong in the project make a note, why it went wrong and how the
                                    team corrected it.</li>
                                <li>After the project is complete make a list of the lessons you learned on this project.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="card-text">Anytime you hear updated information about the project make a note. For example, five
                                years later you could learn that the client is still using the project – make a note of
                                that. If you learn they increased revenue by 50% without adding any staff, then make a
                                note of that. </p>
